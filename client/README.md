# e-commerce app

This is an online store application. The application receives the data, processes it and displays it on the screen. Users can view products, add to cart, change catalog base currency

## During development, I used the following technologies:

+ React;
+ React-router-dom;
+ Redux, react-redux;
+ GraphQL Request;
+ create-react-app;
+ Sass;


## You can run this project locally just do:

+ `git clone https://github.com/saglushevich/e-commerce.git`;

To start the GraphQl server, type:

+ `cd graphQl-endpoint`;
+ `npm i`;
+ `npm build`;
+ `npm start`;

Then run the application:

+ `cd client`;
+ `npm i`;
+ `npm start`;
